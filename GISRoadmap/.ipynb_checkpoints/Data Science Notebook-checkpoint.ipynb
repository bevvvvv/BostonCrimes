    "## What is Data Science?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science at it's core is a cross disciplinary skill. According to Drew Conway's Data Science Venn Diagram it is the intersection of Hacking Skills, Math and Statistics Knowledge, and Substantive Expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Data Science Venn Diagram](img/DataScienceVennDiagram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The skills of a statistician involve knowing how to model and summarize datasets. The skills of a computer scientist involves designing and programming algorithms to process, visualize, and store data. The final skills involve domain expertise which would be \"classical\" training in the subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was mainly designed as a scripting language, but what really lends it to data science is the third party packages available. *NumPy* allows for manipulation of array based data. *Pandas* manipulates labeled data. *Matplotlib* makes publication ready visualizations. *SciPy* enables common scientific computing tasks. *Scikit-Learn* provides machine learning capabilities."
