According to Drew Conway's Data Science Venn Diagram it is the intersection of Hacking Skills, Math and Statistics Knowledge, and Substantive Expertise.\n","\n","![Data Science Venn Diagram](img/DataScienceVennDiagram.png)\n","\n","The skills of a statistician involve knowing how to model and summarize datasets. The skills of a computer scientist involves designing and programming algorithms to process, visualize, and store data. The final skills involve domain expertise which would be \"classical\" training in the subject.\n","\n","### Why Python?\n","\n","Python was mainly designed as a scripting language, but what really lends it to data science is the third party packages available. *NumPy* allows for manipulation of array based data. *Pandas* manipulates labeled data. *Matplotlib* makes publication ready visualizations. *SciPy* enables common scientific computing tasks. *Scikit-Learn* provides machine learning capabilities.\n","\n","## NumPy\n","\n","It is important to understand how to manipulate arrays of data efficiently, since any type of data can be transformed into an array of number. Some examples used in the textbook is transforming pictures, sound clips, and text."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\n","# importing package with an alias"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"version":"3.7.0"},"orig_nbformat":2,"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","npconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":3}}
